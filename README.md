# Grammar Lee

## Project Overview

Grammar Lee is a web application designed to help users reword text in different tones using advanced AI models. This project was code-generated using vibe coding principles, Windsurf, and GPT-4.1.

## Workflow

The development process for this project follows an incremental and iterative workflow:

1. Incremental requirements are documented in Markdown files inside the `prompts` folder (e.g., `requirements-1.1.md`, `requirements-1.2.md`).
2. The application is developed and refined through multiple iterations over these requirements files, ensuring the implementation stays aligned with evolving needs.

## Application Features

- **Gradio Web Application:** The app is built using Gradio, providing an intuitive web interface.
- **API Key Management:** Users provide their Claude API key through a textbox. The key is securely stored in the browser's local storage (BrowserState: `grammar-lee-claude-api-key`). Blank submissions are not allowed.
- **User Interface:**
  - Two-column layout:
    - **Left Panel:**
      - Dropdown to select the tone (`Formal` or `Natural`).
      - Text area for user input.
      - Button to trigger the rewording process.
    - **Right Panel:**
      - Displays the reworded text generated by the AI.
- **Rewording Functionality:**
  - Uses the Anthropic SDK to call the `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` model with a maximum of 500 tokens.
  - The system prompt is: "you are an assistant expert that is an expert writer."
  - The user message format is: `reword and sound <Tone value>. '<Text value>'`.
  - The API key for Anthropic is retrieved from the browser's local storage.

## Technologies Used
- Gradio
- Anthropic SDK
- Python

## How It Works
1. User enters their Claude API key (required).
2. User selects a tone and inputs the text to reword.
3. Upon clicking the button, the app sends a request to the Anthropic API to generate the reworded text.
4. The response is displayed in the right panel.
